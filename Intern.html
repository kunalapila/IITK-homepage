<h3>Day 1: May 16, 2016</h3>
I started with the coursera course “Functional Programming Principles in Scala” by Martin Odersky. Before that, I checked out a few videos by Martin himself on the powers of Scala, including his talk at OSCON 2011.
<p>Finished week 1, which included basics of Scala, like expressions, functions (with recursion), nesting & lexical scoping. I also covered evaluation strategies (call by value and call by name), along with the substitution model. Functional Programming is indeed very powerful, and I plan to discover more about it in the following days to come.
<h3>Day 0: May 15, 2016</h3>
Arrived in Campus, met Adarsh and got to know of my tasks precisely and decided how I would go about learning Scala, akka and other tools. I decided to make a github page, but was lazy enough so I went on with created a normal webpage on my IITK homepage.
