<h3>Day 8: May 23, 2016</h3>
Spent most of the day getting Ixchel to work on my computer. There were several erros which I encountered, many packages which had to be installed which required some googling. Despite that, I was unable to debug them all. Took Vikaraman's help, and finally got compiled sbt.
<h3>Day 5, Day 6 & Day 7: May 20-22, 2016</h3>
Completed the course by Martin Odersky today, and attempted many of the tasks in the assignments. Googled for the ones I was not able to do. Learnt quite a lot of things about Scala and will proceed to learn about akka in the following days, and work on the actual code.
<h3>Day 4: May 19, 2016</h3>
Started working on Scala again. To make sure that I hadn't forgotten what I had learnt 2 days ago, I attempted the assignment for week 1 of the course, and completed it successfully. It took me some time to get used to this functional paradigm, but I liked it in the end, and now I find those tasks trivial. I then moved on to the next 2 weeks of the course for the day. Covered Higher order functions and the technique of currying. Started on with Classes in Scala. In the beginning, it was only revision for me, but later it got somewhat interesting. Relaxing identifiers and using symbols for functions as identifiers made it closer to what we actually write in mathematics, making it more intuitive.
<h3>Day 2 & Day 3: May 17-18, 2016</h3>
Got fever, headache and pain in my eyes, hence wasn’t able to use my laptop for these 2 days.
<p>
I will cover up for the lost time in the next few days.
<h3>Day 1: May 16, 2016</h3>
I started with the coursera course “Functional Programming Principles in Scala” by Martin Odersky. Before that, I checked out a few videos by Martin himself on the powers of Scala, including his talk at OSCON 2011.
<p>Finished week 1, which included basics of Scala, like expressions, functions (with recursion), nesting & lexical scoping. I also covered evaluation strategies (call by value and call by name), along with the substitution model. Functional Programming is indeed very powerful, and I plan to discover more about it in the following days to come.
<p>P.S. It was a Monday, and as we all know, it was Game of Thrones and Silicon Valley Day too :p
<h3>Day 0: May 15, 2016</h3>
Arrived in Campus, met Adarsh and got to know of my tasks precisely and decided how I would go about learning Scala, akka and other tools. I decided to make a github page, but was lazy enough so I went on with created a normal webpage on my IITK homepage.
